Steps to Run the Image Editor (Streamlit Version)
1. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have all the required dependencies installed. You can install them using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install streamlit pillow numpy
2. Navigate to the Project Directory
Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd c:\Users\Mansi Patel\python_project\Mini project\Task-1
3. Run the Application
Execute the Python script to start the Streamlit interface:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
4. Open the Interface
Once the script is running, Streamlit will automatically open the web interface in your default browser. If not, check your terminal for a URL similar to:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:8501
5. Use the Image Editor
Upload an image.
Apply transformations:
Flip, rotate, convert to black and white, resize, adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation.
View and download the processed image.
6. Notes
Ensure all dependencies are installed in a virtual environment if necessary.
The processed images will be saved in the same directory as processed_image.<format>.
If you face any issues, check the terminal for error messages.
